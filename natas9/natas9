After logging in, we see a search field with the context of "Find words containing", and "Output" area, and a view sourcecode link. Clicking submit with nothing in the input box gives back nothing.
Searching for "a" in the serch field gives an output of words containing the letter 'a'.
After clicking on the view sourcecode link, we see the alogorithim script used to search a dictionary.txt file for words containing a letter or string of letters. 

<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
}
?>

One function stands out as a possibly exploitable vulnerability, and that is the passthru() function.
  This function does not check the input, so we can exploit this by inputting a command and telling passthru to ignore everything else in the original script.
We try ; ls and see that works to list the contents of the directory. Now our job is to start digging around and looking for something useful.
  One of the best places to find information pertaining to passwords is also the /etc/ directory. ; ls /etc/ reveals a natas_webpass directory. Inside is a natas10 file.
; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 outputs the natas10 password.
