First connect to the website 
  http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org
Log in with the Username: natas0 and the Password: natas0
It states that "You can find the password for the next level on this page."
The word "page" stand out here. Since we obviously cannot see a password on the webpage, my first step is to check the source code for the webpage.
  Right click, Inspect.
The password for natas1 is sitting right there in a source code comment.
