Here we see two links that go to the "Home" page and the "About" page. After clicking on each one, I see in the URL that the index.php script is calling the "Home" and "About" page from the host system.
Sometimes a vulnerability can exist that allows the php script to call anything written in the URL after 'page='. Without knowing exactly where to go next, I check the source code for the web page. 
Here I see a hint that says "hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8". This could be a file that the index.php script can call, so I change the target of the index.php script to hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8.
  Acces granted, the web page loads to reveal the natas8 password.
