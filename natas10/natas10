First connect to the website

Log in with the Username: natas10 and the Password: D44EcsFkLxPIkAAKLosx8z3hxX1Z4MCE
After logging in, we see a search field with the context of "Find words containing", and "Output" area, a view sourcecode link, and an additional phrase "For security reasons, we now filter on certain characters". 
This is very similar to natas9, however the sourcecode is slightly different.
After clicking on the view sourcecode link, we see the alogorithim script used to search a dictionary.txt file for words containing a letter or string of letters. 

<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    if(preg_match('/[;|&]/',$key)) {
        print "Input contains an illegal character!";
    } else {
        passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
    }
}
?>

This script still uses passthru() except it filters out the '/[;|$]/' characters. This means we will have to force grep to return our natas 11 password.
Because we know where the passwords are stored, we know that we will need to grep the /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 file. The * option for grep will return anything before or after your parameters. 
  n* /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 outputs the natas11 password.
