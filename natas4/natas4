First connect to the website 
  http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org
Log in with the Username: natas4 and the Password: tKOcJIbzM4lTs8hbCmzn5Zr4434fGZQm
It states that "Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/""
I need to be able to trick the web application into thinking I am coming from another website. I use Referer Control on Google Chrome to change the web address that I am visiting from to http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/.
  After a quick refresh, I have been given access to the natas5 password.
