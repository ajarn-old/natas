After logging in, we see a 'Find words containing' field, a 'Search' button, and an "Output:' area. In addition, we now have additional instructions stating 'For security reasons, we now filter even more on certain characters'.
Opening the sourcecode shows that we are dealing with something similar to natas9 and 10, but even more characters are being filtered out.

<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    if(preg_match('/[;|&`\'"]/',$key)) {
        print "Input contains an illegal character!";
    } else {
        passthru("grep -i \"$key\" dictionary.txt");
    }
}
?>
