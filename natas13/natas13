First connect to the website 
  http://natas13.natas.labs.overthewire.org
Log in with the Username: natas13 and the Password: D44EcsFkLxPIkAAKLosx8z3hxX1Z4MCE
After logging in, we see the same instructions from natas12, including a 'Choose File' button and an "Upload File' button with the instructions to 'Choose a JPEG to upload 9max 1KB):'.
The difference this time is that an additional security tag as been added 'For security reasons, we now only accept image files!'
Now we must figure out how to trick the filter into thinking our php script is .jpg image.
Step 1: Same as natas 12, we need to make sure the website accepts file uploads other than .jpg. Inspect the web page and change vallue="g5viynuyt3.jpg" to vallue="g5viynuyt3.php"
Step 2: Create a simple php script that can echo the desired password. We know what to use and where to look thanks to an earlier natas challenge.
  <?php
  echo passthru('cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas14'); 
  ?>
Step 3: Since the website now filters for a .jpg signature, we need to use a hex editor like https://hexed.it/ to edit your .php scrit so that it looks like a .jpg instead. We know what hex signature to add to the front of the .php file thanks to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures is FF D8 FF E0.
Step 4: Upload your edited script.
  Now we have access to the natas14 password.
