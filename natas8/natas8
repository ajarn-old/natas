First connect to the website 
  http://natas8.natas.labs.overthewire.org
Log in with the Username: natas8 and the Password: a6bZCNYwdKqN5cGP11ZdtPg0iImQQhAB
After logging in, we see an Input secret field, a submit button, and a view sourcecode link. Clicking submit with nothing in the input box gives back a wrong secret message.
After clicking on the view sourcecode link, we see the alogorithim script used to encrypt the secret and the encoded secret itself. 
$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";
function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
Using the reverse process the first thing I did was take the encoded hex and convert it to a string. Then, we reverse the string order. Finally, we use base64 to decode the string. 
This gives us the secret oubWYf2kBq
After entering that secret into the input box and clicking submit, we are granted access to the natas9 password.
